# The future of Data Science positions: *A look at the evolution of remote career options*
---

The field of Data Science has rapidly evolved over the past decade, and with it, so have the options for Data Science professionals looking to build a career. In the past, Data Science jobs were largely confined to traditional office settings, with employees commuting to a central location to work alongside their colleagues. However, in recent years, the rise of remote work has opened up a new world of possibilities for Data Science professionals.  COVID-19 pandemic has further solidified remote positions as a viable and attractive option, leading to unprecedented access to Data Science jobs regardless of geographic location.

As a potential Data Scientist, I am interested in exploring what the industry is currently facing, especially in terms of salary and remote working possibilities, so that I can make a more informed choice when looking for a job. For this reason, I have used the dataset *Data Science Job Salaries* (publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries?datasetId=2268489&sortBy=voteCount)) to analyze the latest trends in this industry and to contrast some popular beliefs about these positions:
- Are remote working opportunities really increasing? 
- Is the remote work culture having an impact on employees' salaries? 
- How is the traffic of employees across the globe? Which continents import foreign labour? And which ones export it? 
- What are the reasons behind these decisions? 

In this article, I try to answer these questions (and some more) about the current state of Data Science and try to give a glance at what the future holds for this fast-growing field to give potential Data Scientists (like me) an overview of the market they are entering. Furthermore, this article can serve as a useful reference point for Data Science jobs in the years to come. 

### The evolution of remote opportunities 
Although the dataset only collects information for the last three years, the first trend that stands out when analyzing this data is the role of remote work in the Data Science landscape. While many Data Science roles can still be found in traditional office settings (around 20%), remote working options are becoming increasingly popular.

Remote positions account for more than half of the total job postings, with a significant increase over the last year, when they have reached over 70%. This suggests that many employers are willing to offer remote work options to their employees, making it easier and more attractive for Data Science professionals to pursue such opportunities. 

### Is the remote culture having any effect on employees' salaries? 
A natural question that arises when looking at the increase in remote positions in the industry is whether this is having any impact on employeesâ€™ salaries, as it may be the case that it is lower due to working from home. However, the data says otherwise.

The popularity and demand within the Data Science industry are increasing every and this is being reflected in salaries, which are also rising.  Particularly striking is the rise in salaries for remote employees, who are the highest-paid group. 

This is great news for potential Data Scientists who want to pursue a career in this field, as it suggests that the industry is becoming more attractive, both in terms of remote opportunities and salaries. 

### Different areas, different salaries 

Another general belief, which we can confirm using the dataset, is that the distribution of salaries is not equal in all the continents.  For instance, the US and Canada are the top-paying countries, while India and Brazil have the lowest salaries.  These differences are clearly reflected in the figure below.

Therefore, combining these large differences in salary between different parts of the world and the boom in the remote work culture, it is logical to expect the emergence of a traffic of employees who live in one part of the world and work in another.  

### The traffic of employees across the globe
