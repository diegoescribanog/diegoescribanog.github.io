# The future of Data Science positions: *A look at the evolution of remote career options*
---

The field of Data Science has rapidly evolved over the past decade, and with it, so have the options for Data Science professionals looking to build a career. In the past, Data Science jobs were largely confined to traditional office settings, with employees commuting to a central location to work alongside their colleagues. However, in recent years, the rise of remote work has opened up a new world of possibilities for Data Science professionals.  COVID-19 pandemic has further solidified remote positions as a viable and attractive option, leading to unprecedented access to Data Science jobs regardless of geographic location.

As a potential Data Scientist, I am interested in exploring what challenges the industry is currently facing, especially in terms of salary and remote working possibilities, so that I can make a more informed choice when looking for a job. For this reason, I have used the dataset *Data Science Job Salaries* (publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries?datasetId=2268489&sortBy=voteCount)) to analyze the latest trends in this industry and to contrast some popular beliefs about these positions, for example: 
- Are remote working opportunities really increasing? 
- Is the remote work culture having an impact on employees' salaries? 
- How is the traffic of employees across the globe? Which continents import foreign labour? And which ones export it? 
- What are the reasons behind these decisions? 

In this article, I try to answer these questions (and some more) about the current state of Data Science and to give a glance at what the future holds for this fast-growing field to give potential Data Scientists (like me) an overview of the market they are entering. Furthermore, this article may serve as a useful reference point for Data Science jobs in the years to come. 

### The evolution of remote opportunities 
Although the dataset only collects information for the last three years, the first trend that stands out when analyzing this data is the role of remote work in the Data Science landscape. While many Data Science roles can still be found in traditional office settings (around 20%), remote working options are becoming increasingly popular.

</figure>

Remote positions account for more than half of the total job postings, with a significant increase over the last year, when they have reached over 70%. This suggests that many employers are willing to offer remote work options to their employees, making it easier and more attractive for Data Science professionals to pursue such opportunities. 

### Is the remote culture having any effect on employees' salaries? 
A natural question that arises when looking at the increase in remote positions in the industry is whether this is having any impact on employees’ salaries, as it may be the case that it is lower due to working from home. However, the data says otherwise.

<figure>

<figcaption align = "center"><b>Figure 2 - Evolution of salary in the last three years. </b></figcaption>
</figure>

The popularity and demand within the Data Science industry are increasing every year and this is being reflected in salaries, which are also rising.  Particularly striking is the rise in salaries for remote employees, who are the highest-paid group. 

This is great news for potential Data Scientists who want to pursue a career in this field, as it suggests that the industry is becoming more attractive, both in terms of remote opportunities and salaries. 

### Different areas, different salaries 

Another general belief, which we can confirm using the dataset, is that the distribution of salaries is not equal in all the continents.  For instance, the US and Canada are the top-paying countries, while India and Brazil have the lowest salaries.  These differences are clearly reflected in the figure below. 

<figure>

<figcaption align = "center"><b>Figure 3 - Mean salary in USD($) per continent. </b></figcaption>
</figure>

Therefore, combining these large differences in salary between different parts of the world and the boom in the remote work culture, it is logical to expect the emergence of a traffic of employees who live in one part of the world and work in another.  

### The traffic of employees across the globe 

The implementation of the remote working culture and the existence of large salary differentials are leading to the emergence of flows of Data Science professionals across the global market, where some countries are importing foreign talent and others are exporting it. And the figures below clearly represent the tendency. 

On the one hand, the data shows that there is an increase in the proportion of foreign workers in countries such as the US and Canada (located in North America), who can benefit from the higher salaries in these locations without having to move there.  On the other hand, the Data Science industry in emerging countries such as India, Pakistan and Brazil (located in Asia and South America) are exporting global talent due to their lower salaries and the large existing pool of Data Science professionals.

<figcaption align = "center"><b>Figure 5 - Total number of exported employees per continent. </b></figcaption>
</figure>

Therefore, the countries located in North America are the most benefited from these flows of professionals looking for better salaries and the opportunity to work remotely, while the countries that appear more in the exporting list, located in Asia, Europe and South America, are losing some of their employees and will potentially have difficulties to find qualified individuals among their population. 

### Is the money the only cause of this traffic? 

Obviously, it is clear that economic differences seem to be the main reason for this traffic of remote employees between different parts of the world, so that the question whether this would be the only cause came to my mind. For this reason, I decided to study the comparison between the salaries of people working in the same continent where they reside and those working in a different one for the three continents that export the most number of employees: Asia, Europe and South America. 

<figure>
<img src="https://github.com/diegoescribanog/DSND-Project-1/blob/main/Images/Q7_Salary_comparative.png?raw=True" alt="Trulli">
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Figure 6 - Salary comparative between the employees who work in the same/different continent where they reside.  </b></figcaption>
</figure>

In the figure above, we can see that employees who reside in Asia or South America and work outside their continents clearly have higher salaries. However, this doesn’t happen for the European ones. This could be caused by the desire of some European data scientists to find jobs with better working conditions, not always related to money, such as the flexibility and convenience that remote work provides, allowing them to work from the comfort of their own homes.

### Conclusions 

The outlook for the future of Data Science looks bright, thanks to the increasing presence of remote work and the rise in salaries. This provides numerous opportunities for potential Data Scientists and reinforces the potential of this field as a lucrative option. 

As technological advances continue to shape the face of the industry, remote work looks to be here to stay, and it appears that this shift favours Data Science professionals in terms of salary and accessibility to a wider job market. Overall, it is clear that the rise of remote working opportunities has opened the gates to a new landscape of possibilities for Data Science professionals, which is not only making the industry more attractive but also reshaping the traditional career structure and the dynamics of the global Data Science market.

Going into the future, Data Science technology is expected to evolve and the industry is expected to offer increasingly attractive opportunities and remuneration to potential Data Scientists. With the rise in remote working options, the pool of available and qualified Data Scientists is widening, and this is good news for both employers and potential candidates.

By understanding the current trends and disparities in the Data Science industry, and with the right skills, our options can be substantially improved. I am excited to continue my journey and seek out the best opportunities available!
